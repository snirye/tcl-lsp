the grammer using treesitter and bindings


TODOs:
- [x] tree-sitter gramar (need add tests for more cases)
- [ ] check src file content is the same as generated from grammar on push
- [ ] add tests for more types
- [ ] need to find out how to place the binding under parser dir and not in parser/src
